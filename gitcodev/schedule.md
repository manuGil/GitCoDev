# Schedule
The course consists of four lessons, and a lesson per day is a good way to deliver the content. 
Our experience has shown that participants prefer four consecutive days. 
However, adapting the schedule to fit an audience's preferences is it very reasonable. Thefore,
the schedule provided here should seve as a guide and be adapted to the needs of the participants. 

## Lessons
Lessons are organized so that participants are gradually introduced to the content. 
The content of subsequent lessons depends on previous lessons; therefore, 
we discourage changing the order of the lessons. 
Refer to [our teaching approach](teaching-approach) to learn why the order of the lessons matters in this course.

| Lessons  | Day   |
| :------- | :---- |
| Lesson 1 | Day 1 |
| Lesson 2 | Day 2 |
| Lesson 3 | Day 3 |
| Lesson 4 | Day 4 |

## Sessions
A lesson has been designed to be delivered in one session. In our experience, 
the legth of a session should be at least four hours, but we do not recommend to exceed four and a half hours.  
The content of each lesson has been optimized to provide the content in a way that reduces the cognitive load of the participants. 
We recommend delivering each lesson following the following timetable.


| 00:00        | 00:50         | 01:00        | 01:50         | 02:10        | 03:00         | 03:10         | 04:00           | 04:10   |
| :----------- | :------------ | :----------- | :------------ | :----------- | :------------ | :------------ | :-------------- | :------ |
| Teaching 50' | **Break 10'** | Teaching 50' | **Break 20'** | Teaching 50' | **Break 10'** | Teaching  50' | **Wrap-up 10'** | Closure |


`````{important}
If a session must be longer than what it is suggested above, we recommend to extend the *teaching* 
times up to 60 minutes, and maintain the duration and frequency of the *breaks* to keep the cognitive load at a reasonable level.
