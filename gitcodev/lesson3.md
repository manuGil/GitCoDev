## {octicon}`tasklist` Preparation  

:::{admonition} {octicon}`mortar-board` Instructor's Note 
:class: tip
* The instructor must collect particiapant's user names for GitHub/Gitlab beforehand, so that they can be invited to collaborative repositories. The **username form** serves as an example of how this could be done.
* The instructor must create a repository for [](check-in) using this [respository tempalte](https://github.com/WorkshopGitcodev/check-in-template).

## {octicon}`repo` Episode 1: Collaborative Platforms

### 3.1.1. Connecting to Code Repositories  
{octicon}`clock;1em;sd-text-warning` {bdg-warning-line}`10 min`


* Ask participants using Windows not to start Git Bash clicking on the desktop icon, as they did in Lesson 1. Instead,
    * use the app menu (the Windows logo)
    * pick up Git Bash from the list
    * launch Git Bash with the option **Run as administrator** available from the drop-down submenu.
    The participants may need to type in their credentials as local administrators.
This gain authority to have SSH installing its own features in their laptop next.

:::{admonition} {octicon}`mortar-board` Instructor's Note  
:class: tip
At their very first `git push`, Git might complain about a mismatch between the credentials of local and global administrator.
The warning itself suggests another Git command as the remedy to this impasse.
:::

#### Setting up SSH connection for GitHub

:::{admonition} {octicon}`mortar-board` Instructor's Note 
:class: tip
GitHub requires authentication via SSH to do pulls and pushes, but not for cloning public repositories. Explain what a SSH connection entitles (slides).

Some participants might have already set up SSH keys for GitHub. In this case, they can skip the next steps. They can check if they have SSH keys by running the following command in the terminal:

```shell
    ssh -T git@github.com # for GitHub
```
:::

* If a SSH connection must be set, do the following in a BASH terminal:

    1. Create a Key-pair inside the `.ssh`  in the Home directory
        ```shell
            # move to Home directory
            cd ~
            # create key
            ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
            # save to the default location and file name: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
        ```

    2. Check the keys have been created
        ```shell
            ls ~/.ssh/
        ```

    3. Start the `ssh-agent` and add the **private** key to agent. This might be necessary for Windows users only.
        ```shell
            # start ssh-agent in the background
            eval "$(ssh-agent -s)":
        ```shell
            # start agent
            eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

            # add private key
            ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
        ```
    4. If a the private key was not save on the default directory, instruct SSH to use key files in different locations:
        ```shell
            ssh -i <path/private/keyfile>
        ```

        :::{admonition} {octicon}`mortar-board` Instructor's Note 
        :class: tip
        Window's user would need to set up the *ssh-agent** to [start the automatically](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases#auto-launching-ssh-agent-on-git-for-windows)
        Mac and Linux user don't have to worry about this.
        :::
    5. Copy public key to GitHub:
        ```shell
            clip < .ssh/id_ed25519.pub
        ```

        :::{admonition} {octicon}`mortar-board` Instructor's Note 
        :class: tip
        Go to GitHub, explain the basics of the interface and
        :::

    6. add the SSH key.
        ```shell
            Profile > Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key > Add SSH key
        ```

    7. Test SSH connection
        ```shell
            ssh -T git@github.com
        ```

        :::{admonition} {octicon}`mortar-board` Instructor's Note 
        :class: tip
        The message for a successful outcome is friendly and plain. Ask participants whether git@github.com has welcomed them.
        :::

#### Publishing Local Repository to GitHub 
{octicon}`clock;1em;sd-text-warning` {bdg-warning-line}`5 min`


1. Create GitHub Repo: Go to GitHub and create an public empty repository called `workshop`. Repo description: *workshop on collaborative development*

2. Add Remote to Local Repo: before this remove any existing remotes in the locare repository with: `git remote remove <remote-alias>`

Move back to the repo directory: `~/Desktop/`
In your local repository (on the terminal), add the remote repository and push the content.

* Connect to remote
    ```shell
        git remote add origin git@github.com:<user-name>/<repo-name>.git
    ```

* Check that remote was added
    ```shell
        git remote -v
        git branch -M main # [Optional if config was changed. This will change the name of the main branch of the repo to make it more friendly]
        git push -u origin main
    ```

#### Check the Content is in GitHub
Go back to your repo page and refresh the browser.

### 3.3.1. Documenting Issues
{octicon}`clock;1em;sd-text-warning` {bdg-warning-line}`8 min`


Issues help to document ideas and tasks in a development project. They facilitate planning, discussing  and tracking the progress of a software project.

:::{admonition} {octicon}`mortar-board` Instructor's Note 
:class: tip
Do-along. Instruct participants on how to crate issues in the repository used in [](check-in). Participants create at least one issue in such repository.
:::

Collaborative workflows are estrategies to organise the work of a development team, so that developers can independently can undertake development task while keeping their work aligned with overal project goals. 
Two common estrategies that use version control and collaborative platforms as leverage are:

- The **branching workflow** and
- The **forking workflow**
